## Introduction
The restaurant industry relies heavily on data to make informed decisions about operations, marketing, and customer satisfaction. This project analyzes a dataset containing various attributes related to restaurant operations, including sales, customer demographics, and more. The goal is to provide actionable insights to stakeholders.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information on:

+ Customer details (age, preferences, etc.)
+ Restaurant performance metrics (revenue, number of visits, etc.)
+ Other relevant attributes (e.g., location, cuisine type, ratings)
  
Note: The dataset is either sourced from Kaggle or a custom database. Ensure to comply with the usage rights of the dataset.

## Objectives

1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights.
2. Visualize key trends and relationships in the data.
3. Identify factors affecting restaurant performance.
4. Provide actionable recommendations based on data findings.

## Tech Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries/Tools:
    - Pandas
    - NumPy
    - Matplotlib
    - Seaborn
    - Jupyter Notebook
  
## Features
